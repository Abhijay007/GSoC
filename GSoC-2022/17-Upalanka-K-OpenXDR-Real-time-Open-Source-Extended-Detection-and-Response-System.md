# OpenXDR

Real-time Open Source Extended Detection and Response System

# Project Abstract

OpenXDR is a real-time open source extended detection and response system. The extensibility of OpenXDR allows integration with existing detection systems. Hence, it can seamlessly integrate with various information security systems such as Endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems, Network Detection and Response (NDR) systems, Security information and event management (SIEM) systems, and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).

# Work Summary

For the GSoC 2022, I've initiated the console implementation of the OpenXDR project from scratch and implemented the required functionality using proposed technologies. This required collaboratively implementing core modules of OpenXDR console that is vital for a minimal viable product. I have successfully initiated the project, engineered the user inferface and implemented core functionaly the the OpenXDR dash board to manage schemas, manage nodes and resource monitioring. Project work is carried out by following industry and open source standards.

# What Covered

* Designed OpenXDR dashboard and console UI flow and wireframes
* Initialized React project and configured dependencies
* Designed and implemented resource management(create, edit, delete) features
* Designed and implemented front end user interfaces for log mangagement and monitoring functionality
* Designed and implemented project overview inferface by compiling required information
* Collaboratively designed OpenXDR server API
* Integrated OpenXDR dashboard with backend services following OpenAPI standards

# What left

* Mobile device support for the implemented OpenXDR console
