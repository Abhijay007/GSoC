# Project Abstract

The CrawlerX is a platform that we can use to crawl web URLs in a distributed fashion with different types of protocols. Web scraping, commonly referred to as web scraping, is a method of programmatically traversing a collection of web pages and extracting data, which is useful for data analysis using web-based data. Using a web crawler, you can mine data about a set of products, get lots of textual or quantitative data to use, get data from sites that don't have an official API, or just satisfy your own personal curiosity. However, with the existing implementation, it has a very bad user experience to place or schedule crawl jobs and some UIs are not very user friendly. As defined in project ideas on the organization site, this proposal has provided a new theme for CrawlerX end-users.

# Work Summary

For GSoC 2022, I mainly contributed to CrawlerX's new Web UI. As the part of development, I used VueJS as the main Javascript library with state management features. During the first phase, I had few meetings with my mentor to decide on a theme and finalize the UI template to proceed with the application. Please refer to the demo UI image below.
