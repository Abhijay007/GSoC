# Project Abstract
CodeLabz is a platform where the users can engage with online tutorials and the organizations can create tutorials for the users. The platform is developed using ReactJS front-end library and the back end is developed using the Google Cloud Firestore and Google Firebase Real-Time database. The main aim behind this year's GSOC project was to develop consistent UI and improve the Front End.

# What Covered
- Worked on creating [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/hvSWAy7dyuE9437OLgsK67/CodeLabz---prototype) designs for all the pages, although at the end we finalised one of the project co-worker's design.
- Removed old stories from storybook
- Organised new storybook stories
- Fixed the broken CI/CD pipeline
- Created UI components
- Wrote Cypress tests for the components

# What left
- Some of the functionalities are not yet connected with the backend
- Improvisation of code editor
