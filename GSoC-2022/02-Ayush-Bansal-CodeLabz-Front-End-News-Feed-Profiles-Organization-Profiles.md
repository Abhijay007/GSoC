# Work Summary

During GSoC'22 I worked on the frontend part of the CodelabZ project. In the first half of my GSoC journey, I worked on material UI components. I implemented the new design of few components(organization profile, user profile banners, user profile cards, etc) and pages(organization feed page) that are completely re-usable. I replaced the components for the same and also made the new components responsive. All the components are mostly mobile-friendly and highly optimized. I worked on storybook components for our project and deployed them. Here storybook is nicely organized, the user can control components props on his own and do some experiments with components. I also wrote frontend tests (cypress) for the same component of our project. In the later part of my journey, i worked on connection these components with firebase. In the end, I fixed some existing bugs and updated documentation for this project. Finally, this project turned out to be a good one with many functionalities and a cool UI/UX design.

# What Covered
- all the components were updated according to new design
- storybook has also been updated.
- all the components are tested.
- Removed small bugs and Grammatical errors.
- worked on the pre-GSoC tasks that included creating figma design for the website and creating the storybook according to that design.


# What left
- firebase functions for few of the added functionalities needs to be implemented.
